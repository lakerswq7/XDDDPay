# XDDD Pay
This is a modern as a service (COMS E6998) course at Columbia University. This application gives us the oppurtunity to practice the implementation of the following features.
- User log in and log out with JWT
- Implement basic shopping cart
- Use stripe API
- use [Elastic Beanstalk](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/create_deploy_nodejs_express.html) to serve our pages and server.


## Packages and engines used
1. [Express](http://expressjs.com), a node js web framework that works as the main url redirecting tool.
2. [jade](), a template engine that makes writing html more elegant, but it's basically html, but less code.
3. 


## Structure
- bin: entry point, where we really setup the server and serve this application
- public: a directory storing most of the static contents including images, css and javascript files.
- routes: for each route, we have different handlers, or different part of programs that handle that request, they are all defined in here.
- views: most of the jade and html files are in here (which is pretty obvious regarding its name).

#### To complete the setting, read [app.js](https://github.com/mw10104587/XDDDPay/blob/master/app.js)
